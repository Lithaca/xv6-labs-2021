## RISC-V assembly

Q1: Which registers contain arguments to functions?

A1: According to RISC-V calling convention, the function arguments are saved
in register `a0`-`a7` and calling stack(for more arguments)

Q2: Where is the call to function `f` in the assembly code for main?
Where is the call to `g`?

A2: The assembly code indicates that the function `f` and `g` is regard as
`inline` function which means they are expanded and excuted during the
compiling time.

Q3: At what address is the function `printf` located?

A3: The function printf located in va `0x628`

Q4: What value is in the register `ra` just after the `jalr` to `printf` in
`main`?

A4: va `0x38`

Q5: run the code

A5: output: "He110 World"

If the RISC-V is big-endian, `i` should be `0x726c6400` and `57616` need not
to change.

Q6: the number after "y=" will be unexpected since the `printf` has a
various length parameter list and the behaviour will be undefined in the
sence.
